# Install Fine Art Calc without App Stores (Android + iPhone)

This guide helps you install Fine Art Calc without using the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

- For iPhone: the easiest and most reliable option is to use the Web App (Add to Home Screen). No computer required, no fees.
- For Android: you can install a Web App (Add to Home screen) or directly install an APK file provided by the sender.

If your sender shared links, keep them handy:
- Web App URL: https://YOUR-WEB-URL.example (replace by actual link the sender gave you)
- Android APK URL: https://YOUR-DIRECT-APK-LINK.example/fine-art-calc.apk

Only install from sources you trust.

## iPhone (iPhone 13 or newer)

### Option A — Recommended: Install the Web App (Add to Home Screen)
This places an app icon on your Home Screen that opens the app in full screen. No Apple ID or fees.

1) Open Safari on your iPhone.
2) Visit the Web App link: `https://YOUR-WEB-URL.example` (use the link you received).
3) Tap the Share button (square with an up arrow).
4) Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen".
5) Optionally rename the app, then tap "Add".
6) Find the new icon on your Home Screen and open the app.

Notes:
- Works like an app and launches full screen. Some device features (push notifications, deep native integrations) are not used by this calculator, so you shouldn’t miss anything.
- Updates happen automatically when you revisit or refresh.

### Option B — Advanced: Sideload via AltStore (requires a computer)
Use this only if you specifically received a `.ipa` file and you’re comfortable with a computer. With a free Apple ID, the app must be re-signed every 7 days.

High-level steps:
1) On a Mac or Windows PC, install AltServer (https://altstore.io/). Follow their instructions to install "AltStore" onto your iPhone.
2) On iPhone, open AltStore and sign in with your Apple ID (AltStore uses it to sign the app for your device).
3) Download the provided `.ipa` file on your iPhone (from the link you received).
4) In AltStore, go to "My Apps" → tap the "+" and choose the downloaded `.ipa`.
5) Wait for AltStore to sign and install the app. The icon appears on your Home Screen.

Important:
- With a free Apple ID, the sideloaded app expires in 7 days unless refreshed via AltStore.
- You may need to trust the developer profile: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Trust (if prompted).

## Android phones

### Option A — Install the Web App (Add to Home screen)
1) Open Chrome (or your browser) on your phone.
2) Visit the Web App link: `https://YOUR-WEB-URL.example`.
3) Open the browser menu (⋮ in Chrome) and tap "Add to Home screen".
4) Confirm to add the icon. Launch from your Home Screen.

Notes:
- Updates are automatic when the website updates.

### Option B — Install the APK (Direct download)
Use this if you received an APK link. This installs the native Android app without the Play Store.

1) Download the APK from the link you received (e.g., `fine-art-calc.apk`).
2) When you open the downloaded file, your phone may prompt you to allow installs from this source.
   - On Android 8.0+ (modern phones):
     - Settings → Apps → Special app access → Install unknown apps → choose the app you used to download (Chrome or Files) → Allow.
   - On older Android versions: Settings → Security → enable "Unknown sources".
3) Go back to the APK file and open it again to install.
4) If prompted, tap Install. When finished, open the app from your app drawer/Home Screen.

Uninstalling:
- Long-press the app icon → Uninstall (or go to Settings → Apps → Fine Art Calc → Uninstall).

Security tip:
- Only install APKs from sources you trust.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Is the iPhone Web App the same as a "real app"?
  - It looks and feels like an app and runs full screen. It doesn’t use iPhone-only features that this calculator doesn’t need.

- Will it work offline?
  - The Web App may work after the first load depending on your device/browser caching. For best results, open it at least once with internet access.

- How do I get updates?
  - Web App: updates appear the next time you open/refresh the app.
  - Android APK: you’ll need to install a newer APK if one is provided.

- I got a warning about installing from unknown sources (Android). Is that normal?
  - Yes, Android warns for apps installed outside Google Play. Proceed only if you trust the source.

- Do I need to pay anything?
  - No payments are required for the Web App on iPhone or Android. APK installs on Android are also free.
  - The advanced iPhone sideloading option (AltStore) requires a computer and periodic re-signing; no recurring payments, but some maintenance is needed.
